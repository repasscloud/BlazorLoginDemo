## 1. Scope
This Schedule defines invoice generation, delivery, payment methods, timing, dispute handling, and consequences of non‑payment for Supplier’s SaaS Platform and related Services billed to Vendor L1.

## 2. Billing Model
2.1 **Hierarchy.** Supplier invoices **Vendor L1 only**. Vendor L1 is responsible for any downstream billing to TMCs and Clients.  
2.2 **Units & Measurement.** Billing metrics and counting rules are per the **Price Book & Tiering Schedule** and CTA (e.g., monthly peak active users, metered API calls, storage).  
2.3 **Minimums & True‑Ups.** Minimum Commit, quarterly true‑up, and overage are as set out in the CTA and Price Book.  
2.4 **Proration.** Mid‑period activations or deactivations are prorated to the day unless the CTA states otherwise.

## 3. Invoicing
3.1 **Frequency.** Monthly in arrears unless otherwise specified in the CTA. One consolidated invoice per calendar month.  
3.2 **Invoice Date.** Issued within five (5) business days after month‑end.

## 4. Taxes and Surcharges
4.1 **GST.** Prices exclude GST. Supplier will issue valid tax invoices under the **A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth)**. Vendor L1 must pay GST in addition to the consideration.  
4.2 **Withholding.** No deductions or set‑off for taxes or withholdings. If law requires withholding, Vendor L1 will **gross‑up** so Supplier receives the amount it would have received absent withholding.

4.4 **Other Taxes.** Duties, levies, and government charges are payable by Vendor L1 unless the CTA allocates otherwise.
