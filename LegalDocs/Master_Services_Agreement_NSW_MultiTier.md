*Markdown version for download and internal use.*  
*Governing law: New South Wales, Australia.*

---

## Parties

- **Supplier**: *[Insert full legal name]* ACN *[●]*, of *[Address]* (“**Supplier**”).  
- **Customer**: *[Insert full legal name]* ACN/ABN *[●]*, of *[Address]* (“**Customer**”).

**Multi‑party model (tick all that apply in the Order Form):**  
- ☐ **Vendor (L1)** — Customer resells/operates downstream tenancies.  
- ☐ **Vendor (L2)** — Appointed by Vendor (L1) under Customer’s tenancy.  
- ☐ **TMC** — Travel Management Company operating under Customer or Vendor.  
- ☐ **End Client** — Customer’s or Vendor’s downstream business customer.

> Ticking a role authorises its onboarding **within Customer’s tenancy**. Unless Supplier signs a direct agreement with a downstream entity, **Customer remains liable** for that entity and its Users.

---

## Background

A. Supplier operates the SaaS platform described in **Schedule 2 (Services Description)**.  
B. Customer will subscribe and may onboard downstream entities (Vendor L2, TMCs, End Clients) as permitted by the Order Form and this Agreement.  
C. The parties agree the terms below and the schedules listed in **Section 18 (Order of Precedence)**.

---

## 1. Definitions and Interpretation

1.1 Capitalised terms have the meanings in **Schedule 1 (Definitions)**.  
1.2 “Downstream Entity” means a Vendor (including Vendor L2), TMC, or End Client authorised under Customer’s tenancy.  
1.3 “Tenancy” means the logical isolation unit provisioned for Customer and its Downstream Entities.  
1.4 Statutory references include updates and subordinate instruments, including the **Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)** and the **APPs**.

---

## 2. Term and Renewal

2.1 **Term.** This Agreement starts on the Effective Date and continues until the end of all active Order Forms/SOWs unless terminated earlier.  
2.2 **Subscription periods.** Each Order Form states the Initial Subscription Term and any auto-renewal. Unless otherwise stated, subscriptions auto-renew for successive one-year periods at then-current rates unless either party gives 60 days’ notice before expiry.  
2.3 **Trial/POC.** Trials are AS-IS, may be terminated at any time, and convert to paid on written acceptance or production use.

---

## 3. Service Access and Use

3.1 **Provision.** Supplier will provide the Service per this Agreement and **Schedule 3 (SLA)**.  
3.2 **Users.** Credentials are individual; no sharing beyond licensed scope.  
3.3 **AUP.** Customer will ensure all Users and Downstream Entities comply with the **AUP (Schedule 9)**.  
3.4 **Multi‑tier onboarding.** Subject to the Order Form “tick set” and **Schedule 24 (Multi‑Tier Annex)**, Customer may onboard the following:  
- **Scenario 1**: Customer is **Vendor (L1)** → may onboard **TMCs** → each TMC may service **End Clients**.  
- **Scenario 2**: Customer is **TMC** → may onboard **End Clients**.  
- **Scenario 3**: Customer is **Vendor (L1)** → may appoint **Vendor (L2)** → L2 may onboard **TMCs** → TMCs may service **End Clients**.  
- **Scenario 4**: Customer is **TMC (direct)** → may onboard **End Clients**.  
Customer ensures contractual flow‑down with each Downstream Entity at least equivalent to this Agreement, the AUP, the DPA, and **Schedule 5 (Security Controls)**.  
3.5 **Prohibited security testing.** No penetration testing, probing, or scanning except within Supplier’s approved program or by written authorisation.  
3.6 **Third‑Party Services.** Integrations are “as available”; third‑party terms may apply.

---

## 4. Professional Services

4.1 Supplier may provide implementation, migration, customisation, training, and consulting as **Professional Services** under a **SOW** using **Schedule 15**.  
4.2 Deliverables, milestones, Customer dependencies, acceptance criteria, and fees appear in the SOW.  
4.3 Time and materials services are billed monthly against actuals unless a fixed fee is specified.

---

## 5. Fees, True‑Up, and Taxes

5.1 **Who is invoiced.** Supplier invoices the **contracting Customer** (Vendor L1 or TMC as applicable). Customer is solely responsible for collecting from its Downstream Entities; non‑payment by them does not relieve Customer’s obligations.  
5.2 **Allocation.** If the Order Form/CTA specifies redistribution of charges or credits to Downstream Entities, Customer is responsible for that allocation.  
5.3 **True‑Up/Minimum Commit.** Per **CTA (Schedule 7)**. Grace bands and overage apply at the **tenancy level** unless the Order Form states per sub‑tenancy.  
5.4 **Price Floors / Revenue Share (optional).** If **Schedule 18/19** applies, Vendor must not resell below the Price Floor and must report billable units for revenue share on **Collected Net Revenue**.  
5.5 **Taxes/Late payment.** As previously issued.

---

## 6. Service Levels and Support

6.1 **Availability and credits.** Per **SLA (Schedule 3)**. **Credits accrue to the contracting Customer** for the affected tenant(s). Redistribution to Downstream Entities applies only if stated in the Order Form/CTA.  
6.2 **Support split.** L1/L2 functional support is provided by the contracting Customer (Vendor or TMC) and its appointed operators. Supplier provides L3 under **Schedule 6**. 24/7 application‑level support requires purchase in the Order Form/CTA.  
6.3 **Maintenance windows and exclusions.** As per **Schedule 3**.

---

## 7. Data, Privacy and Security

7.1 **Roles.** Supplier processes Personal Information to provide the Service. The **contracting Customer** is the APP entity for its tenancy and is responsible for notices and consents for all Downstream Entities and Users within that tenancy.  
7.2 **Subprocessors, Security, NDB.** As per **Schedules 4–5**. Supplier remains responsible for its Subprocessors.  
7.3 **Data separation.** Supplier enforces logical isolation between tenancies and sub‑tenancies. No cross‑customer access.  
7.4 **Data export and residency.** Per **Schedule 22** and the Order Form.

---

## 8. Customer Responsibilities

Expanded to include:  
- **Flow‑down.** Ensure each Downstream Entity accepts and complies with AUP, DPA, Security Controls, and any CTA pricing conditions.  
- **Boundaries.** Do not grant access outside the authorised chain or residency options in the Order Form. Additional tiers require Supplier’s consent.  
- **Downstream audits.** Customer is responsible for monitoring and auditing its Downstream Entities’ use.

---

## 9. Intellectual Property; OSS; Feedback

9.1 **Ownership.** Supplier and its licensors own the Service and Documentation, including all related IP Rights. No rights are granted except as expressly set out.  
9.2 **Customer Materials.** Customer retains ownership of Customer Data and any Customer-provided materials.  
9.3 **Open Source.** Open-source components are used under their licences listed in Documentation or a notice file. To the extent of conflict, the OSS licence governs that component.

10.1 Customer must not: violate law; infringe IP; introduce malware; circumvent security; overload or abuse APIs; share credentials; or probe or scan the Service except through approved security testing programs.  
10.2 **Shared Resources.** Use must remain within operational thresholds. Supplier may apply throttling or resource caps to preserve stability and fairness.  
10.3 **Suspension.** Supplier may suspend all or part of the Service to a specific User, integration, or tenancy where:  
(a) security risk exists; (b) required to comply with law; (c) material AUP breach; or (d) material non-payment. Supplier will limit suspension to what is necessary and will restore once the issue is resolved.

---

## 11. Warranties and Disclaimers

11.1 **Service Warranty.** During the subscription, the Service will materially conform to the Documentation.  
11.2 **Services Warranty.** Professional Services will be performed with due skill and care by suitably qualified personnel.  
11.3 **Remedies.** For breach of 11.1 or 11.2, Supplier will re-perform, repair, or replace the non-conforming item. If Supplier cannot cure within a reasonable time, Customer may terminate the affected Order Form or SOW for cause and receive a pro-rata refund of prepaid, unused fees.  
11.4 **Disclaimers.** Except as stated, the Service is provided “as is” and “as available”. Supplier does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation, or that the Service will meet Customer’s requirements, or the accuracy of third-party data.

---

## 13. Liability
