this is the file path:
BlazorLoginDemo.Web/Components/Layout/MainLayout.razor


What I need, is a zsh, that will read line 11 of that file, which looks like this:
"            <pre><code>v0.2.22-a11</code></pre>"

the version info here: 0.2.22-a11

is broken down like this: X.Y.Z-aN

a never changes, that will be a letter in lower case, either a,b,r - never anything other than those 3 letters

X = major
Y = minor
Z = patch


I want a script, that when i call it, it will take into consideration these args:

+ "--build" it will increment the number at N by +1
+ "--patch" it will increment the number at Z by +1, reset N = 0
+ "--minor" it will increment the number at Y by +1, reset Z = 0, N = 0
+ "--major" it will increment the number at X by +1, reset Y = 0, Z = 0, N = 0
